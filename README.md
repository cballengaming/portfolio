# portfolio
This is my old portfolio site. This site was made while I was attending the Art Insitute of Dallas. 
Currently I am working on a redesign for this, but until that is ready to be launched, this gives you
the chance to see past projects I have worked on. 

Thank you for taking the time to look over these old projects.
